This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Yunyi Ding (yding13@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Brian Lin (bjlin@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair 
should drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, 
and at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer must
be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work together, learning 
from each other, not to divide the work into two pieces with each 
partner working on a different piece.

Yunyi Ding spent	10 hours working alone.
Brian Lin spent		10 hours working alone.
We spent 			30 hours working together.
Yunyi Ding spent 	15 hours driving.
Brian Lin spent		15 hours driving.
